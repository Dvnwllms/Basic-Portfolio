                <p><img class="headshot" src="./assets/images/Profile Pic.jpg" alt="Photo of Devon">My spirit animal is a Hungry hungry Hippo, I am a master at Nap Kwan Do, and have been working with codes since I was a kid (up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, A, B, A, B, Start).  I like going to the gym and playing videogames in my spare time.  Gaming has always been a huge hobby of mine since I was little.  I've gone from playing videogames, to building (struggling if you ask some) PCs, to now working with code! It'd be great to one day have the opportunity to work on a game, even if its a small one. Yes, Minesweeper counts!</p>
                <p>Thanks to my spirit animal I am also a big foodie, food person, grub guy? No matter what you call it I like to go on all those food adventures! My favorite foods are easy to guess.  The almighty Burrito and Taco sit atop the food pyramid casting judgement down on all lesser foods. Snickerdoodles have also been scientifically proven to be baked by angels, which is easy to understand! Thats me at a glance! Come back later when I actually fill this with proffessional info.</p>
